TASK 3: BUSINESS CARD (Construction Company)

A business card is a highly personal form of marketing, and does exactly what you need it to. 
Business cards serve the key purpose of marketing your business and getting 
your key contact information into your client's hand all in a matter of seconds. 
Fundamental to the value of the business card, is its portability.

Visual Elements:
Color Palette : Business cards with black and yellow schemes are often read as construction-related due to those colorsâ€™
                use to paint equipment and road signs. 

Typography : good business card since all the information is being communicated via text. 
             Fonts used are easy to read and make sense for the type of work you do. 

Layout : A balanced and intuitive layout that make the information easily accessible.

This project was a fantastic learning experience,and I'm thrilled with how it turned out.
Software used : Figma
